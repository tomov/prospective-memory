HALT!!!

MAIN ISSUE:

Target monitoring in the same dimension as the OG stimuli =>

   it excites the OG response just as much as the PM response!!!!

   => need separate pathway.... damn, Gilbert really had it

   ===> THE TARGET DETECTION PATHWAY!!! DUH...



perception = input + attention + target - bias

-bias => nothing (no input)
input - bias => OG randomly/rarely, no PM (not paying attention)
attention + input - bias => focal: OG, PM; nonfocal: OG, rarely PM
target + input - bias => nonfocal PM (this only applies in nonfocal condition, the definition of focal is that you're paying attention to the dimension of the target)
target + attention + input - bias => nonfocal: PM

target + input - bias >= attention + input - bias 


in PM condition, 

= Trigger task switch:

attention + input - bias    (focal)
target + input - bias       (nonfocal)
target + attention + input - bias

= do NOT trigger task switch:

input - bias
attention - bias
target - bias
attention + target - bias


=> GOVERNING EQUATIONS FOR PERCEPTION INPUT WEIGHTS:

input <= bias
attention < bias
target < bias
attention + target < bias

input + attention > bias
input + target > bias

target >= attention ( perhaps strictly > to elicit shorter RT's for PM misses)


FUCK... THINGS THAT ARE NOT WORKING NOW AND WE WANT TO WORK

1. Activation in target perception should slow down / inhibit activation in OG responses!!!
   --- you dumb fuck, of COURSE the way you've designed it, right now target monitoring excites the target units which ALSO excite the OG responses!!!!! fuck......

2. Excitation in task unit should slow donw / inhibit OG responses



the problem could be:
- kWTA

.... you ?
