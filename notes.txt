-- NEXT ISSUE:

OG RT's with monitoring are proportional to the error rate
- more monitoring => slower OG RT's but also more errors...




-- MAIN ISSUE:

Target monitoring in the same dimension as the OG stimuli =>

   it excites the OG response just as much as the PM response!!!!

   => need separate pathway.... damn, Gilbert really had it

   ===> THE TARGET DETECTION PATHWAY!!! DUH...

resolved!!!


------------------------ TARGET DETECTION LAYER ---------------

target = monitor + perception - bias - ACT * self

...so, in the absence of perception, 

target = monitor - bias - act * self

in the equilibrium,
0 = monitor - bias - act * self

act = (monitor - bias) / self

Also, we want to keep act less than 0.5 b/c otherwise it pushes too much into the response and we get too many false alarms. A good set of values is

monitoring weight = 2
self = 3 (-3 in the code)
bias = 1 (-1 in the code)

That way we get equilibrium activation = 1/3 which is perfect, gets OG accuracy = 80% and OG RT = 144 for monitor level = 1
Note that this is when at the beginning of each trial, we set activation for targets = x 1/2 (i.e. we havle it rather than set it to 0)


------------------------- RESPONSE LAYER --------------------------

response = perception + task - bias

task - bias <= 0
perception - bias <= 0, or at least close to it

------------------------- PERCEPTION LAYER ------------------------

perception = input + attention + target - bias

-bias => nothing (no input)
input - bias => OG randomly/rarely, no PM (not paying attention)
attention + input - bias => focal: OG, PM; nonfocal: OG, rarely PM
target + input - bias => nonfocal PM (this only applies in nonfocal condition, the definition of focal is that you're paying attention to the dimension of the target)
target + attention + input - bias => nonfocal: PM

target + input - bias >= attention + input - bias 


in PM condition, 

= Trigger task switch:

attention + input - bias    (focal)
target + input - bias       (nonfocal)
target + attention + input - bias

= do NOT trigger task switch:

input - bias
attention - bias
target - bias
attention + target - bias


=> GOVERNING EQUATIONS FOR PERCEPTION INPUT WEIGHTS:

input <= bias
attention < bias
target < bias
attention + target < bias

input + attention > bias
input + target > bias

target >= attention ( perhaps strictly > to elicit shorter RT's for PM misses)
